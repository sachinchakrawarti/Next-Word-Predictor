# Next-Word-Predictor

A simple **Next Word Prediction** project that predicts the most likely next word based on a given text sequence. This project demonstrates basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and language modeling techniques.

## 📌 Features
- Predicts the next word from a given sentence
- Uses text preprocessing and tokenization
- Implements a basic language model
- Easy to understand and extend

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Text data is cleaned and tokenized  
2. Sequences of words are generated  
3. A model learns word patterns  
4. Given an input phrase, the model predicts the next word  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras *(optional – depending on your implementation)*
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
